Goal is to train a neural network with tetris data \
Things to do: 
- Scrape games and transform it into readable game instructions ✔
- Create a version of tetris in python suited for 40L sprint, that can take instructions.
  - Board with methods:
    - Print board ✔
    - Start queue ✔
    - Removes lines
    - Hold current piece ✔
    - Board height
  - Pieces with methods
    - TBD

We need to transform the queue into pieces first
